# Amiga playground

Amiga assembly code playground, it includes examples, simple demos, trainers, etc..

## Native tools

* Asm-One (v1.02 / v1.20)
* IFF-Converter (many versions were produced, they are more or less all good)

## External tools

* [XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert) - an image converter to multiple formats
* [Amigeconv](https://github.com/tditlu/amigeconv) - a graphics converter for different Amiga bitplanes, chunky & palette formats

## How to run 

1. Download and run your favourite version of Asm-One; all the demo and examples here were tested with **1.02** and **1.20**
2. Select the workspace memory (100 KB is good)
3. Load the source (command 'R')
4. Type 'a' (assemble) and then type 'j' (jump)
